# Lifeline Android

Lifeline Android is part of the blood donor system we implemented for the [Ready, steady, code 1.0 Hackathon](http://rsc.foi.hr).
The accompanying web application for donor institutions is located [here](http://lifeline.code.sexy/).

Our team of four won the 3rd prize!

The repository containing the code for the whole system is located [here](https://github.com/foivz/RSC-Wrecking-Ball).

## About the RSC Hackathon

The Hackathon was held on the 22nd and 23rd of november 2014. The task (a blood donor system) was revealed at the beginning of the hackathon and all the teams were given 24 hours to design and implement the system and to create a short presentation about the implemented system.

After the 24 hours were up and everyone got a bit of sleep all the teams presented their implementations.
The organizers then graded the teams using a range of criteria and declared the winners.
